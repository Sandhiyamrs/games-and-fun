# ⚛️ Elastic Collision Simulator

This program simulates a **1D elastic collision** between two objects.

## 🧠 Physics Concept
- Conservation of momentum
- Elastic collision equations

## 📌 Inputs
- Mass of both objects
- Initial velocities

## 📤 Output
- Final velocities after collision

## ▶️ Sample Run

Enter mass of object 1 (kg): 2  
Enter velocity of object 1 (m/s): 5  
Enter mass of object 2 (kg): 3  
Enter velocity of object 2 (m/s): -2  

FINAL VELOCITIES  
Object 1 Final Velocity : -1.40 m/s  
Object 2 Final Velocity : 5.60 m/s

## 🎯 Learning Outcome
- Understand momentum conservation
- Apply physics formulas using Python
