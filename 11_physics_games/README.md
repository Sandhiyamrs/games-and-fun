## 📌 Sample Outputs

### ▶ Gravity Ball Simulation
🌍 Gravity Ball Simulator
Initial Height: 80 meters

t=1s → Height = 75.1m

t=2s → Height = 60.4m

t=3s → Height = 35.9m

t=4s → Height = 1.6m

t=4.2s → Ball has hit the ground! 💥


### ▶ Spring Motion Simulation
🌀 Spring Motion Simulation
Mass = 1kg | k = 20

Position over time:
t=0.0 → 0.00m

t=0.5 → 0.31m

t=1.0 → -0.31m

t=1.5 → -0.00m

Oscillation Complete ✔
