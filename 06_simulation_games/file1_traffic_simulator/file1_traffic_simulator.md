# 🚦 Traffic Simulator

## 📝 Problem Statement
Simulate traffic flow at a single intersection with a traffic light. Cars arrive randomly; the light cycles through Green → Yellow → Red. Track queue length, throughput, and average waiting time.

## 🧪 Example
Run simulator for 100 time steps with arrival_prob=0.3 and green_time=5.

## ✔️ Notes
- Discrete time simulation
- Adjustable arrival probability, light cycle times, car speed
