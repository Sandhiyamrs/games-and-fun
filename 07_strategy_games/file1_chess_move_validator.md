# ♟️ Chess Move Validator

## 📝 Problem Statement
Validate chess moves for standard pieces (king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, pawn) on an 8×8 board. Determine if a given move is legal (basic rules only; no castling, en passant, or promotion logic required).

## 🧪 Example
Input: piece = "knight", from = "g1", to = "f3" → Output: True

## ✔️ Notes
- Uses algebraic coordinates (a1 ... h8)
- Validates piece movement and board boundaries
