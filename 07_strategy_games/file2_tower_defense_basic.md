# 🛡️ Tower Defense — Basic Simulation

## 📝 Problem Statement
Simulate a basic tower-defense wave: enemies follow a fixed path of waypoints; towers placed on map shoot nearest enemy within range; track enemy HP and tower fire rate.

## 🧪 Example
One tower (range 2, damage 3) vs a wave of 5 enemies.

## ✔️ Notes
- Console simulation with discrete time steps
- Simple target selection (closest to exit)
